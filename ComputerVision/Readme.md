This project is a Coding(Python) Implementation of whatever I learn releated to Computer Vision.<br />
This is mainly to get more hands-on for my better understanding.<br />
Clear explanation is given with comments and docstrings, I hope it will be very helpful for beginners.<br />

Topics Covered:<br />
Image<br />
<image_drawing.py><br />
1. Reading, Color conversion and displaying image with opencv, numpy and matplotlib.<br />
2. Image resizing, drawing shapes over images(fixed size and also mouse drags using callbacks).<br />

<image_processing.py><br />
3. Blending and Pasting of images(Masking included).<br />
4. Image threshold(Normal and Adaptive methods).<br />
5. Blurring and smoothing(Gaussian Blur, Median_blur, gamma correction).<br />

<image_morphology.py><br />
6. Erosion and Dilation to shrink and expand image region respectively.<br />
7. Opening and closing methods to remove background and foreground noise.<br />

<edge_detection.py>
8. Gradient methods for Edge detection(sobel operator, laplace operator).<br />
